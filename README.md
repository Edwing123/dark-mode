# dark-mode example

A dark mode example made with HTML, CSS and TypeScript


## required installations

As the JavaScript part is made with TypeScript, first we need to 
get typescript, to do this we can install it with npm

```
npm install -g typescript
```

check if typescript cli tool is installed by running the next command on your terminal
```
tsc --version
```

the `tsconfig.json` has the necessary configurations,
install typescript, after that just run

```
tsc 
```

this command will generate the `main.js` file in the `dist/js/` folder

after all these steps, just open `index.html`
